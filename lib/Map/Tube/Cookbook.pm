=head1 DESCRIPTION

Cookbook for L<Map::Tube> library.

=head1 SETUP MAP

C<Map::Tube v3.22> or above now supports map data in XML and JSON format. Here is
the Structure of map in XML format:

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <tube name="Your-Map-Name">
        <lines>
           <line id="Line-ID"
                 name="Line-Name"
                 color="Line-Color-Code" />
           .....
           .....
           .....
           .....
        </lines>

        <stations>
           <station id="Station-ID"
                    name="Station-Name"
                    line="Line-ID:Station-Index"
                    link="Station-ID"
                    other_link="Link-Name:Station-ID" />
           .....
           .....
           .....
           .....
        </stations>
    </tube>

And same in JSON format:

   {
       "name"  : "Your-Map-Name",
       "lines" : {
           "line" : [
               { "id"    : "Line-ID",
                 "name"  : "Line-Name",
                 "color" : "Line-Color-Code"
               },
               .....
               .....
               .....
               .....
           ]
       },
       "stations" : {
           "station" : [
               { "id"         : "Station-ID",
                 "name"       : "Station-Name",
                 "line"       : "Line-ID:Station-Index",
                 "link"       : "Station-ID",
                 "other_link" : "Link-Name:Station-ID"
               },
               .....
               .....
               .....
               .....
           ]
       }
   }

The root of the xml data is C<tube> having one optional attribute C<name> i.e map
name and two childrens C<lines> and C<stations>.

The node C<lines> has one or more children C<line>. The node C<line>  defines the
'Line' of the  map. The  node  C<line> has to have the attributes C<id>, C<name>.
Optionally it can have C<color> as well. They are explained as below:

    +-----------+---------------------------------------------------------------+
    | Attribute | Description                                                   |
    +-----------+---------------------------------------------------------------+
    |           |                                                               |
    | id        | Unique line id of the map. Ideally should be numeric but can  |
    |           | be alphanumeric. It shouldn't contain ",".                    |
    |           |                                                               |
    | name      | Line name of the map. It doesn't have to be unique as long as |
    |           | it has unique line id.                                        |
    |           |                                                               |
    | color     | Line color is optional. It should have color name or hexcode. |
    |           |                                                               |
    +-----------+---------------------------------------------------------------+

Example from L<Map::Tube::Delhi> as shown below:

    <line id="Red" name="Red" color="#8B0000" />

The node C<stations>  has one or more children C<station>. The node C<station> is
used to represent  'station'  of  the map.It must have attributes C<id>, C<name>,
C<line> and C<link>. It can optionally have attribute C<other_link>.

    +------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
    | Attribute  | Description                                                  |
    +------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
    |            |                                                              |
    | id         | Unique station id of the map. Ideally should be numeric but  |
    |            | can be alphanumeric. It shouldn't contain ",".               |
    |            |                                                              |
    | name       | Station name of the map.It doesn't have to be unique as long |
    |            | as it has unique station id.                                 |
    |            |                                                              |
    | line       | Represents the station line alongwith the station index on   |
    |            | the line. It should be ":" separated, e.g. "Red:2". It means |
    |            | this is the first station on the line 'Red'. Station index   |
    |            | is NOT mandatory but nice to have. If the station crosses    |
    |            | more than one lines, then they should be listed as ","       |
    |            | separated. For Example, "Red:9,Green:16".                    |
    |            |                                                              |
    | link       | Represents all linked stations to this station. e.g. "B04"   |
    |            | If it is linked to more than one stations then they should   |
    |            | be listed as ", " separated. For example "B04,B02".          |
    |            |                                                              |
    | other_link | This attribute is optional. This is useful if the station is |
    |            | linked via other link and not by any of the lines, e.g. some |
    |            | stations are linked by tunnel. This can be defined as        |
    |            | "Tunnel:B02"                                                 |
    |            |                                                              |
    +------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+

Example from L<Map::Tube::London> without station index:

    <station id="B003"
             name="Bank"
             line="Central,DLR,Northern,Waterloo &amp; City"
             link="S002,S024,L013,M011,L012,W008"
             other_link="Tunnel:M009" />

Example from L<Map::Tube::Delhi> with station index:

    <station id="B03"
             name="Dwarka Sector 9"
             line="Blue:3"
             link="B04,B02" />

Let us create xml map for the following map:

      A(1)  ----  B(2)
     /              \
    C(3)  --------  F(6) --- G(7) ---- H(8)
     \              /
      D(4)  ----  E(5)

Below is the XML representation C<sample.xml> of the above map:

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <tube name="Sample">
        <lines>
           <line id="L1" name="L1" />
        </lines>
        <stations>
           <station id="L01" name="A" line="L1:1" link="L02,L03"         />
           <station id="L02" name="B" line="L1:2" link="L01,L06"         />
           <station id="L03" name="C" line="L1:3" link="L01,L04,L06"     />
           <station id="L04" name="D" line="L1:4" link="L03,L05"         />
           <station id="L05" name="E" line="L1:5" link="L04,L06"         />
           <station id="L06" name="F" line="L1:6" link="L02,L03,L05,L07" />
           <station id="L07" name="G" line="L1:7" link="L06,L08"         />
           <station id="L08" name="H" line="L1:8" link="L07"             />
        </stations>
    </tube>

Next is the JSON representation C<sample.json> of the above map:

   {
       "name"     : "Sample",
       "lines"    : { "line"    : [ { "id" : "L1", "name" : "L1" } ] },
       "stations" : { "station" : [ { "id" : "L01", "name": "A", "line": "L1:1", "link": "L02,L03"         },
                                    { "id" : "L02", "name": "B", "line": "L1:2", "link": "L01,L06"         },
                                    { "id" : "L03", "name": "C", "line": "L1:3", "link": "L01,L04,L06"     },
                                    { "id" : "L04", "name": "D", "line": "L1:4", "link": "L03,L05"         },
                                    { "id" : "L05", "name": "E", "line": "L1:5", "link": "L04,L06"         },
                                    { "id" : "L06", "name": "F", "line": "L1:6", "link": "L02,L03,L05,L07" },
                                    { "id" : "L07", "name": "G", "line": "L1:7", "link": "L06,L08"         },
                                    { "id" : "L08", "name": "H", "line": "L1:8", "link": "L07"             }
                                  ]
                    }
   }

=head1 CREATE MAP

You would need the C<Map::Tube> v3.22 or above to be able to support JSON format.

Following code manage the map data in XML format.

    package Sample::Map;

    use Moo;
    use namespace::clean;

    has xml => (is => 'ro', default => sub { 'sample.xml' });
    with 'Map::Tube';

    package main;
    use strict; use warnings;

    my $map = Sample::Map->new;
    print $map->get_shortest_route('A', 'D');

In order to support map data in JSON format, just replace the line below:

    has xml => (is => 'ro', default => sub { 'sample.xml' });

with

    has json => (is => 'ro', default => sub { 'sample.json' });

=head1 MAP GRAPH

To print  the  entire  map or just a particular line map, just install the plugin
L<Map::Tube::Plugin::Graph> and you have all the tools to create map image.

    use strict; use warnings;
    use MIME::Base64;
    use Sample::Map;

    my $map  = Sample::Map->new;
    my $name = $map->name;
    open(my $MAP_IMAGE, ">$name.png");
    binmode($MAP_IMAGE);
    print $MAP_IMAGE decode_base64($map->as_image);
    close($MAP_IMAGE);

=head1 FUZZY FIND

To enable the  fuzzy  search ability to the sample map, you would need to install
L<Map::Tube::Plugin::FuzzyFind>  and  you have everything you need to perform the
task.

    use strict; use warnings;
    use Sample::Map;

    my $map = Sample::Map->new;
    print 'Line contains: ', $map->fuzzy_find(search => 'a', object => 'lines');

=head1 VALIDATE MAP

There is handy  package L<Test::Map::Tube> that can help you in testing the basic
map structure and functionalities.

    use strict; use warnings;
    use Test::More;

    my $min_ver = 0.09;
    eval "use Test::Map::Tube $min_ver tests => 2";
    plan skip_all => "Test::Map::Tube $min_ver required" if $@;

    use Sample::Map;
    my $map = Sample::Map->new;
    ok_map($map);
    ok_map_functions($map);

=head1 SEARCH ALGORITHM

Lets take the same sample map.

        1 -------- 2
       /  \      /   \
      /    \    /     \
     0 ------ 6 ------ 3
      \     /  \      /
       \   /    \    /
        5 -------- 4

We would build a table as follows:

    +--------+---------------+
    | Vertex | Path | Length |
    +--------+------+--------+
    | 0      |  -   |  INF   |
    | 1      |  -   |  INF   |
    | 2      |  -   |  INF   |
    | 3      |  -   |  INF   |
    | 4      |  -   |  INF   |
    | 5      |  -   |  INF   |
    | 6      |  -   |  INF   |
    +--------+------+--------+

In the table, the  index  on  the left represents the vertex we are going to (for
convenience, we will assume that we are starting at vertex 0). We will ignore the
Known field; it is only necessary if the edges are weighted. The Path field tells
us  which  vertex  precedes us in the path. The Length field is the length of the
path from  the  starting  vertex  to that vertex, which we initialize to INFinity
under  the assumption that there is no path unless we find one, in which case the
length will be less than infinity.

We begin by  indicating  that 0 can reach itself with a path of length 0. This is
better  than infinity, so we replace INF with 0 in the Length column, and we also
place a 0 in the  Path  column. Now  we  look  at 0's neighbors. All three of 0's
neighbors 1, 5, and 6  can  be  reached  from  0 with a path of length 1 (1 + the
length of the path to 0, which is 0), and for all three of them this is better,so
we update their Path and Length fields and then enqueue them because we will have
to look at their neighbors next.

We dequeue 1, and look at its neighbors 0, 2, and 6. The path through vertex 1 to
each of those vertices would have a length of 2 (1 + the length of the path to 1,
which is 1). For 0 and 6 this is worse than what is already in their Length field
so  we  will  do  nothing  for  them. For  2, the path of length 2 is better than
infinity, so  we will put 2 in its Length field and 1 in its Path field, since it
came from 1, and  then we will enqueue so we can eventually look at its neighbors
if necessary.

We dequeue the 5 and look at its neighbors 0, 4, and 6. The path through vertex 5
to each of those vertices would have a length of 2 (1 + the length of the path to
5, which is 1). For  0  and 6, this is worse than what is already in their Length
field, so we will do nothing for them. For 4, the path of length 2 is better than
infinity, so  we will put 2 in its Length field and 5 in its Path field, since it
came  from 5,  and  then  we  will  enqueue  it  so we can eventually look at its
neighbors if necessary.

Next we  dequeue the 6, which shares an edge with each of the other six vertices.
The  path  through  6 to any of these vertices would have a length of 2, but only
vertex  3  currently has a higher Length (infinity), so we will update 3's fields
and enqueue it.

Of the remaining items in the queue the path through them to their neighbors will
all  have  a  length of 3, since they all have a length of 2, which will be worse
than  the values that are already in the Length fields of all the vertices, so we
will not make any more changes to the table. The result is the following table:

    +--------+---------------+
    | Vertex | Path | Length |
    +--------+------+--------+
    | 0      |  0   |  0     |
    | 1      |  0   |  1     |
    | 2      |  1   |  2     |
    | 3      |  6   |  2     |
    | 4      |  5   |  2     |
    | 5      |  0   |  1     |
    | 6      |  0   |  1     |
    +--------+------+--------+

Now if we  need to know how far away a vertex is from vertex 0, we can look it up
in the table.
